\title{Weave elements of two matrices of vectors
Weaves two matrices or vectors whereby rows (elements) of first matrix (vector) are interspersed with rows (elements) of the second matrix, one by one.}
\usage{
weave(a, b, inpar_b = TRUE, rnames = NULL, excl_0 = TRUE,
  within_col = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A vector of matrix. Rows (elements) to be weaved.}

\item{b}{A vector or matrix. Rows (elements) to weave into \code{a}.}

\item{inpar_b}{Logical. Whether to enclose elements in \code{b} with parenthesis.}

\item{rnames}{A character vector. Names of elements in each row of \code{a} (assumed the same in \code{b}).}

\item{excl_0}{Logical. Whether to exclude values of `0` in \code{b}.}

\item{within_col}{Logical. If \code{a} and \code{b} are vectors, `TRUE` weaves elements into one column and `FALSE` returns \code{a} in the first row, and \code{b} on the second row.}

Weave elements of two matrices of vectors
Weaves two matrices or vectors whereby rows (elements) of first matrix (vector) are interspersed with rows (elements) of the second matrix, one by one.

\examples{
weave(letters[1:5], 1:5, inpar_b = FALSE)
means <- round(runif(3), 3)
sds <- round(runif(10), 3)
weave(means, sds, rnames = c("var1", "var2", "var3"))
